As many of you know, Flammarilva was originally the author of this mod, but due to his circumstances could not continue development so he released the project as open source. Then Armbrust took the initiative to revive the mod, and brought together a small team to accomplish that. So huge thanks to Flammarilva for the awesome mod, and also to Armbrust for getting the ball rolling again.

## Localizations

We are in need of localizations for the language files.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/10VR4mI_EuEy0AHBI5pbqmronLN5paB0vjuhpZ99UL3A/edit?usp=sharing

Here's a google doc of the English language file. If you'd like to localize it please do so.  You can either submit it directly to the github, or any other way you'd want to send it to us would be fine.

Fossils and Archeology Revival 1.47 Build 0004 is released!

BUILD 0004 Preview CHANGELOG ----------

- Phase I of dinosaur riding has begun
- All dinosaurs are rideable now (Pterosaurs are fun! )
- Hitboxes now scale better with dinosaur age
- Plesiosaurs no longer kill themselves inside blocks
- Block dot in the Culture Vat GUI is gone
- Dinosaur speeds tweaked
- Dilophosaurus/Rex sizes are more appropriate
- Angry trex will break blocks
- Triceratops will break blocks
- Added Dino_Starve option in the config
- Added Skull_Overlay option in the config
- There's more, I can't think of them right now. :B


Sorry to disappoint those waiting for a 1.5.* update. You folks will just have to wait a little longer.

Some notes, Mosasaurs die when attacking other mobs... I could not figure it out and Shadow is out for the weekend.

RIDING! Phase I of riding is in, and you can ride dinosaurs now, and be able to control them with WASD as long as you have the whip out.
To ride a pterosaur, you must start off from at least 3 blocks high, run forward and fall and immediately press and hold "S" to pull up.

BLOCK BREAKING. Dinosaurs can break blocks again. Have a rampaging Rex and it'll destroy a lot of things. You can disable it in the config.

There is a new overlay blur for the Skull Helmet. Because of the way this works, there's a config option now called Skull_Overlay which defaults to false. To get the overlay, you must grab skullhelmetblur.png from /Fossils-Archeology/textures/ and put it into your minecraft.jar's /misc folder. Then enable Skull_Overlay in the Fossils.cfg.

IMPORTANT: DELETE YOUR OLD Fossil.config file (located in ./minecraft/config/).
SERVER OWNERS READ THIS, CLIENTS IGNORE: For this build, there's an option in the config,

```
B:Heal_Dinos=true
```

Set this to false, unfortunately this will disable dinosaurs healing, but when true dinosaurs will still disappear.

## Fossils Public Server

This server is run by 4f6f3b, and where he usually hangs out if anyone has any questions.

**fossils.noip.us:25865**

He has a zero tolerance policy on griefing, and will kick and ban with little warning. Yes it is a public server, but please play nice and let people enjoy the mod with other people.

Also, please PM him on the Minecraft Forums with anything related to the server rather than post it on the thread.
